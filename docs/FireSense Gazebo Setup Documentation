Running Drone Simulations in Gazebo:

Once Gazebo and PX4 are installed, do this to run the forest fire world with fireducks in it with the iris sitl drone in it too:

sathiya@SKL1:~/PX4-Autopilot$ make px4_sitl gazebo___forestfires

It will boot gazebo with the drone, forest, and fires in  it.

Once Gazebo and MAVSDK are installed:
navigate to this directory and run: "sathiya@SKL1:~/MAVSDK-Python/examples$ python3 mission.py"

This will start the mission for the drone and it will fly around
